Description 
SmartCart AI is an intelligent layer that enhances your existing e-commerce shopping cart to drive conversions and increase average order value. By leveraging the power of machine learning, SmartCart AI analyzes customer behavior in real-time to deliver personalized product recommendations, dynamic offers, and intelligent upsells directly within the cart. It identifies shoppers who are about to abandon their purchase and deploys targeted, automated recovery campaigns via email or push notifications to bring them back.
The platform integrates seamlessly with all major e-commerce systems and provides a powerful analytics dashboard to track performance and gain deep insights into customer purchasing patterns. SmartCart AI moves beyond a static checkout process, transforming your cart into a dynamic and personalized sales tool that adapts to every shopper, maximizing revenue from the traffic you already have.
